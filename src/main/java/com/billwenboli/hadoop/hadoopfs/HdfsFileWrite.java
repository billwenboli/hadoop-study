/**
 * Hadoopâ€™s default strategy is to place the first replica on the same node as the client
 * (for clients running outside the cluster, a node is chosen at random, although the system
 * tries not to pick nodes that are too full or too busy).
 * The second replica is placed on a different rack from the first (off-rack), chosen at random.
 * The third replica is placed on the same rack as the second, but on a different node chosen at random.
 * Further replicas are placed on random nodes in the cluster, although the system tries to avoid
 * placing too many replicas on the same rack.
